I used [tdhooper's shadertoy-frame-exporter](https://github.com/tdhooper/shadertoy-frame-exporter) a lot. It's a great tool, but I felt some limitations: downloading lots of images in the browser can be annoying, settings have to be changed every time, and I had to manually convert the images into GIF or MP4 videos. This project solves these problems.
